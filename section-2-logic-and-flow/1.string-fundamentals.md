String Fundamentals

In JavaScript, strings are immutable. This means that once a string is created, its value cannot be changed. Any operation that appears to modify a string actually creates a new string.

Here's an example:

let str = "Hello";
str[0] = "h"; // This doesn't work
console.log(str); // Still outputs "Hello"

When you perform operations on strings, you're creating new strings:

let str = "Hello";
let newStr = str + " World";
console.log(str); // "Hello"
console.log(newStr); // "Hello World"

While strings and arrays are different data types, they share many similar methods. For example, both support methods like:

    includes()
    indexOf()
    length
    slice()

However, remember that unlike arrays, strings are immutable, so methods that modify arrays (like push() or pop()) don't exist for strings.
