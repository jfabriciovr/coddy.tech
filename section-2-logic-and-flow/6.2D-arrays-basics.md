# 2D Arrays Basics

A 2D array is an array containing sub-arrays. Each sub-array can be seen as a row in a grid.

For example:

```js
const cinema = [
  [true, true], // Row 0
  [false, true], // Row 1
];
```

This array represents a 2x2 grid (2 items in each row, and there are 2 rows)

To create a 2D array of integers with 3 rows and 4 columns, you would write:

```js
const matrix = [
  [1, 2, 3, 4],
  [5, 6, 7, 8],
  [9, 10, 11, 12],
];
// 3x4 grid
```

## Accessing 2D Array Elements

Accessing elements in a 2D array is similar to accessing elements in a 1D array, but instead of using a single index, you use two indices: one for the row and one for the column.

For instance:

```js
const seats = [
  ["A1", "A2", "A3"],
  ["B1", "B2", "B3"],
];
// seats[0][2] -> 'A3'
// seats[1][1] -> 'B2'
```

Remember that indices in JavaScript start at 0, so the first row is at index 0, the second row is at index 1, and so on.
