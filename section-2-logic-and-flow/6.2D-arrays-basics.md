# 2D Arrays Basics

A 2D array is an array containing sub-arrays. Each sub-array can be seen as a row in a grid.

For example:

```js
const cinema = [
  [true, true], // Row 0
  [false, true], // Row 1
];
```

This array represents a 2x2 grid (2 items in each row, and there are 2 rows)

To create a 2D array of integers with 3 rows and 4 columns, you would write:

```js
const matrix = [
  [1, 2, 3, 4],
  [5, 6, 7, 8],
  [9, 10, 11, 12],
];
// 3x4 grid
```
