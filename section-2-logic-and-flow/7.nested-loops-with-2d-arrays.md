# Nested Loops with 2D Arrays

When working with 2D arrays, we often use nested loops to iterate over each row and each column, allowing us to access or modify every element in the array.

Here's a typical structure of nested loops for a 2D array:

```js
const seats = [
  [true, true, false],
  [true, false, true],
];

for (let r = 0; r < seats.length; r++) {
  // Outer loop iterates over rows
  for (let c = 0; c < seats[r].length; c++) {
    // Inner loop iterates over columns
    // seats[r][c] can be accessed here
  }
}
```

The outer loop iterates over the rows, and the inner loop iterates over the columns of each row. This way, you can access each element in the 2D array by using `array[r][c]`.
