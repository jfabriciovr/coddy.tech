# Matrix Addition & Substraction

To add or subtract two matrices, they must have the same dimensions (i.e., the same number of rows and columns). The operation is performed element-wise, meaning you add or subtract corresponding elements in each matrix.

For example:

```js
Matrix A:
1 2
3 4

Matrix B:
5 6
7 8

A + B:
(1+5) (2+6)
(3+7) (4+8)

Result:
6  8
10 12
```

Matrix multiplication is more complex and it will be covered in a later section.
